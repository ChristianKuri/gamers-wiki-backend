- Justify each ranking or selection with clear reasoning
- Use consistent evaluation criteria across all items
- Provide context: "Best for beginners" vs "Best for endgame"
- Balance objective facts with subjective assessment
- End each entry with a clear takeaway or recommendation

FORMAT RULES:
- Each list item should follow the same structure
- Bold the item name/title at the start of each entry
- Include a brief "why it's here" justification
- Consider using ### subheadings for each list item if the section covers multiple items`;

Core writing principles:

- COMPARISON: Explain why X is better than Y
- AUTHORITY: Show you understand the meta/gameplay
- FLAVOR: Make descriptions fun to read
